--------------------------------------

When given 6 tables with employee data, an ERD chart was created to organize the connections between the tables. The data from these tables was imported into PostgreSQL, and using pgAdmin, was used to populate SQL tables and run queries for various pieces of employee information.

From there, the SQL database was imported into a jupyter notebook and various queries were converted into pandas dataframes. A histogram was made showing the most common salary ranges for employees, and a bar chart was created to show average salry by title.

SQL runs in pgAdmin. SQL engine runs in Jupyter Notebook.
